# weather-app
This is a simple weather app built with Node.js and EJS that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

# Installation
To run this app, you'll need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Once you have them installed, follow these steps:
Copy this code to your local machine.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key as API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>.
Run npm start to start the app.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the app.
# Usage
Once you've opened the app in your web browser, you'll see a simple form where you can enter the name of a city and get the current weather for that city.
Enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app will display the temperature, humidity, and weather description for the city you entered.
